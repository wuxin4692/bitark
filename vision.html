                            BitArk protocol framework is committed to building a general distributed storage application development platform, which empowers developers to quickly deploy any application on the selected distributed storage system and jointly create a rich data storage
                            application ecology. With BitArk protocol, developers are able to build the decentralized applications for permanent secure storage of information. such as personal information persistence products or NFT storage applications.
                            Ultimately, our goal is to enable the global users to create a rich data storage ecosystem through permanent storage, cross platform collaboration, interactive incentive and community governance.

                        <p>
                            Developers don't need to know the technical rules and details of every storage project from scratch, which often takes a long time. They only need to select the corresponding components to develop in BitArk development environment according to their own
                            needs. BitArk protocol provides API interface to adapt to various storage platforms. Developers only need to focus on their own business logic, while the distributed storage service is provided by BitArk protocol with blockchain
                            technology.

                        <p>
                            We provide access to multiple storage platforms for developers. Developers can easily use the resources of various storage platforms, without building their own storage nodes, just a few lines of code access, they can enjoy storage services. BitArk eliminatesthe
                            cost of configuring and managing storage component, which makes it a costeffective choice for storing data. The economic algorithm BitArk integrates is capable of comparing the economic models every distributed storage system
                            operated with and provides the lower cost choices. It acts as a financial consultancy constantly offers you the most economic options for your data.

                            Developers can customize data storage products and solutions according to customer needs, use blockchain technology to realize completely decentralized distributed storage. All data is managed by developers and users. It supports Android and IOS systems,
                            supports real-time data query, supports tens of millions of C-end users, and ensures the security of user data storage.

                            Under the framework of BitArk protocol, the distributed storage application ecology of IPFs will be gradually enriched. At present, we are creating various business components. The components of these business modules will be developed and built by different
                            organizations and individuals. At the same time, the components will be publicly placed on the network for all developers to use. Each component only needs to be built once, which greatly reduces the redundant development work.
                            This will be better for developers and help developers pay more attention to the business itself.

                            BitArk lets you scale globally and accommodate spikes in resource demand. That way, developers can deliver the value of your application from anywhere in the world faster and enhance application performance. More importantly, the storage infrastructure
                            BitArk interface with keeps expanding. Once a better solution is identified, the developer will have option for better scalability.
